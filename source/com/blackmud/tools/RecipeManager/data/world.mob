gargoyle kiasyd~
Kiasyd, high-king of the gargoyles~
A massive gargoyle crouches in the corner, staring suspiciously at you 
through eyes of stone...
~
  Even crouching, this massive gargoyle towers some ten feet off the 
ground, his six inch talons dig burrows into the stone at his feet, and 
his bat-like wings can stretch out to a full fifteen feet when in 
flight.  Though bestial in appearance, a shimmer in his dark eyes 
indicates a deep intellect.  He shall not strike, unless attacked first, 
but once angered, his wrath knows no bounds.  Kiasyd has traveled here 
to meet with a fellow master of the blades.

they committed against her she lives only for the death of every Tarr.  Her love
for the King is the only passion that is greater.  She is as great a warrior as
any woman of her time, and she is also an immensely powerful sorcerer.

his ability to help.  Since the fall he has remained here in solitude
forgotten by all those who dwell above.  He looks lonely.

himself.  His great black magic and hatred of all good led to his resurrection

eyes glow red in the fog.  Large canine teeth protrude from its strong
jaw.  The coyote stands about waist high for a human.  It snarls like
a cornered wolf, though, by no means does it feel threatened by the
inhabitants of the plateau.  Strong legs propel this beast across the
landscape, retractable claws ready to be used at any time.

overlord tarr~
the Tarr Overlord~
The Overlord of the Tarr leaps to his feet and attacks.
~
   Looking up at this man you wonder which family of giants he came from.
Standing close to nine feet tall and built like a treant, it is easy to see
how he came to rule over all the other Tarr.  He has a thick mane of coal
black hair which hangs down over his broad shoulders.  He has thick black eye
brows that hang down in long braids to the outside of his eyes.  His nose and
mouth are covered by a piece of black metal conformed to his face.  It is
said that he was either born deformed or suffered some serious injury in his
youth.  His voice sounds like a landslide when he speaks, which is very
seldom.  He holds a personal hatred of all the great kingdoms, though it is
not known why.  No one knows his true origin or name.  All that is known is
that he is a man who thrives on hatred.

Tarr created their own religion of hate and fear.  And at the highest altar 
of this religion stands this man.  Like his supposed brother he is known by 
no other name than high priest.

The spirit of King Godemar I floats quickly toward you.
~
   Known to all as Godemar the Great, there was no threat to strong, devious,
or large that he could not overcome.  Armies fell before him.  Kingdoms bowed
before him.  Gods smiled upon him.  He was truly The Great King.  He doesn't
seem very impressed by your presence.

The spirit of King du Falkan I~
The spirit of King du Falkan I floats aggressively toward you.
~
   King du Falkan was the first to reestablish the throne after the collapse
of the Tote empire.  He was the closest in line to the royal family and thus
was the heir to the throne.  He chose the title king for there was no longer a
great empire.

~
   The last of the Tote line, his only fault was to trust those close to him.

~
   There isn't anyone who lived then that would not say that she was why the
word beauty was invented.  She ruled with kindness and justice.  However, she
was not a weak ruler.  There was enough of her father's blood in her to make
anyone who would threaten her think twice.

The spirit of Antali Tote~
The spirit of Antali Tote floats sadly in mid air.
~
   He was the conqueror, the founder, and the ruler of all the land in sight.
He came from a distant land and brought man to this unsettled land.  He ruled
with strength and justice.  No one dared stand against him, for all the people
loved and supported him.  In return he gave them a good and peaceful existence.
He seems saddened by the state of his lands now.

body, and occasionally her frail form breaks out in a convulsion.  Judging
by the dull expression in her eyes, she has been drugged.  She's clad only
in a small, filmy slip.  Kaal's uses for this miserable creature seem readily

  When the pestilence broke out, the blacksmith locked up his son Tristan in
the shop's basement out of the hopes of keeping him from becoming infected.
While Tristan hasn't been exposed to the plague, his lack of any light as
well as a diet that consisted of insects and rats destroyed his grip on
sanity.  At one time, his mother was down here as well, but Tristan murdered 
her when she wouldn't succumb to his wishes.  Now, he has learned to love the 
darkness of his small little, world. You are trespassing in his kingdom of 
vermin, and his highness has decided that the only fit punishment is death.

Dawnpasture's inhabitants, the plague had driven her completely mad, and she

A screaming wraith dressed in tattered robes of office stands in the
pentagaram's center.
~
  Once, long before Scythen came, Cyranaran ruled this land as the noble and
just autarch.  However, when Sanaluth corrupted the mind of his beloved wife
Kelissa, she broke the seals of the Wraith-Tower, and allowed Scythen and his
legions entry into the valleys of Dawnpasture.  When his advisors told him of
her treachery, he had them banished for their treasonous words.  Too late, he
discovered the truth.  In a desperate effort to stop Scythen's forces, he
threw himself into the pentagram which Scythen had been summoned from,
fulfilling an ancient prophecy that if an elf would sacrifice his own soul,
no evil would ever escape the land.  Out of anger, Scythen sealed Cyranaran
within the pentagram, and invoked the black arts to transform him into an
undying wraith.  From the tower's window, Cyranaran has helplessly watched
the plague destroy his land, and all he can do is scream.

~
  Phantasmagoric tears stream down the apparition's pretty face.  Her once
fine clothing indicates that she was once Kelissa, the queen of this realm.
Through no fault of her own, Sanaluth began to corrupt her mind with foul
spells, encouraging her to invoke the spell of summoning which would pull
Scythen forth from his plane and into this one.  At last, the nightmares and
dreams she was afflicted with wore her down, and she assented to the dark
one's wishes.  Her mind was freed just as Scythen and his minions escaped,
so that she could witness first hand the manner in which she had damned her
world.  Driven mad by guilt, she could find no peace, even after committing
suicide.  Now, she wanders across the blasted lands silently observing the
nightmare she helped to create.

more than a child.  Sensing a great capacity for sadism and an unholy thirst
for knowledge within the young creature, he made him into his own "son".  Now,
Maledras has surpassed even Scythen in his nightmarish creations.  He gathers
the few inhabitants who are still uninfected, and uses them as guinea pigs
in his hellish experiments.

odor of rotting meat rises up from his viscous flesh, and large shards of
bone protrude from his cracked and rotting fists.  He is responsible for the
nightmares that the plains have succumbed to, and if you don't stop him, he
will eventually break the seal that keeps him here, and infect the rest of
the world.

resolve of a mountain.  You have heard whispers that he is part Ishaaka, a
by-blow of one of the trollish warriors from when they last invaded the

of battles, and should prove more than enough in keeping any interlopers out

of men into an incredible warrior.  His abilities with the blade are matched
only by his abilities on horseback.  He earned his moniker during the wars
with the hordes, where it was said he fought with the ferocity of the

from engaging in further duty, and entered an early retirement.  Still
wishing to maintain involvement with the cavalier's guild, he has opted to
serve as their innkeeper, and spends his time collecting money from the
young recruits without keeps of their own.

a page boy~
A chubby, young groom waits patiently to look after your horse.
~
  Though the groom undoubtedly dreams of glorious combat, you doubt that he
shall ever see it.  His smile is unctuous at best, and the leathery flaps of
flesh which hang from his obese frame are coated in a thin sheen of sweat.
Still, his skills with horses are well known, and you are certain that he
shall do an admirable job of seeing to yours.

duncan khate king dwarf large~
Duncan Khate~
A large dwarf pours over treatises and documents with his one good eye.
~
  By Dwarven standards, Duncan Khate stands at a gigantic five feet.  His
dark hair is streaked with silver, and he wears his long beard in several
thick braids.  His shoulders are huge, and give way to arms as thick as the
limbs of a grown tree.  Despite the fact that he has only one eye, the King
of Mreec looks as tough and formidable as any veteran adventurer you've met.
Though he will give anything for his people, it is said that in combat he
becomes akin to a hero of the age of legends.  Countless songs chronicle his
part during the wars with the Hordes, and speak of his mythical hammer which
was said to be able to break the land in two.

stare at him, and mutters something unflattering about "tall-folk" beneath
his breath.

  Thuuras B'Shal has been the court mage of Mreec since Grimmur's day.  His
snow-white hair falls down about his wrinkled face, and his bony fingers
drum ponderously upon the surface of the cluttered desk before him.  Due
mainly to the large mistrust of magic throughout the Dwarven society, B'Shal
has become the subject of dark rumors throughout the city.  As he glances
at you, you are reminded of nothing so much as an aging bird of prey.

have taken vows of chastity and dedicated their lives to the pursuit of
spirituality would torment themselves by employing such an attractive servant.

is well cut, and predictably a red color as well.  A foppish man, he prides
himself on "treating any customer as if they were Duncan Khate themselves."
As tempting as sticking a sword in the greasy man might be, the quantity of
armed guards surrounding him make you wonder how wise an idea that really is.

him like some wretched perfume.  As he tinkers with the various vials and

fiction, but you've seen enough displaced nobility in your day to figure it's

herself with a regality befitting Kalara Khate herself, and subtly smoothes the

Following Lucian's victory over the Tarr and their allies, Khate's father
gave the throne to his son, and Khate, in turn turned the entire garrison over 
to his friend's command.  Rumored to be second only to his sire in combat,
Dathaar keeps his head shorn save except for a long scalp-lock and the

of the Wandering Judge to better serve his people's grievances.  After five
or six appointees, Khate finally appointed one of his more respected advisors
to the position.  Un-bribable and just, the judge administers light fines and
other penalties to Mreec's lesser law-breakers.

hammering the dents out of a piece of armor, you realize that the rumors of
the Dwarves' skill with metals are by no means exaggerated.  Strangely, he wears
no beard at all.  The only sign of his adulthood is the long, ugly scar that

occurred in a battle with the Tarr war captain J'Kar.  Despite his handicap,
he is as hard and dangerous as they come.  It is said he could turn a five

he wears his dark hair pulled up into a single, long ponytail.  A thin goatee
covers his angular chin, and the gold and silver jewelry he wears clashes
sharply with the royal-blues and blacks of his clothing.  There are those
in the city who have turned him into some sort of boogey-man to blame for
anything that goes wrong.  Both Khate, and the entirety of the city's
garrison dream of catching Caliban for a crime, but somehow, his hands always
manage to come up clean.

of warm.  The cards of an ancient tarot deck are arranged across the table
before her, but from here, the only card you can see depicts a large raven

guard devil monk devil-monk giant~
The devil-monk guard~
A fanatical monk glares as you approach.
~
  Despite the magnitude of the guard's size, you realize you didn't see him  
until he allowed you to.  He offers you a slight incline of his shaved head,
and a smile that displays both his severed tongue and his sharpened teeth.
Though a foreboding figure, and certainly a man who is not to be trifled with,
he doesn't feel evil per se.  His order are largely considered to operate
outside of Entia's power-struggle, but they did come to Tansar's aid during
the wars.

Llaysyl the Black~
Llaysyl the Black, master of the devil-monks, levitates before you.
~
  Standing with his arms folded across his muscular chest, the Master of the
Devil-Monks hovers three or four feet off the stone-covered ground of the small
island.  His eyes crackle with crimson energy, and his movements are so fast
they are almost a blur.  Long, white hair falls down about his cold, chiseled
face.  Although a frightening figure, he and his order will come to the
world's defenses when Phaet deems it necessary.  His training is rigorous
torture, according to some, yet it is known that he is capable of crafting the
most deadly of Balric's defenders.

Caraathis Grey~
A thin wisp of a woman fixes you with an icy glare.
~
  Caraathis Grey's mouth seems set in a permanent sneer, she stares coldly at
you, and shrugs her shoulders defiantly.  The leader of a matriarchal house
hold, she is more than willing to bully her husband and servants into doing
whatever she wishes.  Her raven-black hair is pulled into a long braid which
runs down her back, and her clenched fists gleam with the silver of dozens
of rings.

Waren Grey~
An older dwarf stares vacantly into a glass of wine.
~
  The old dwarf's face is haggard from time spent worrying over his estates
and the rumors of his wife's affiliations.  He runs a gnarled old hand through
his thinning head of hair, and sighs dissolutely as he sips at his goblet of
wine.  Since his grandfather's time, his household has maintained an allegiance
with a legendary order of monks, but the rumors run rampant that his wife's
contacts might soon drive the infamous Devil-Monks to seek out a new haven.
He nods politely at you, and you wonder how one man can stand such a burden.

Thadaran Maahk~
The king of the revolutionaries bellows at you from atop his throne.
~
  Ritualistic scars and other forms of mutilation disfigure Maahk's chiseled
face.  His bulbous nose was broken repeatedly in his youth, and his teeth
are green with rot and corrosion.  He glares disgustedly at you, and bellows in
rage that your very presence defiles his court.  As the grinning figures of
his guards advance upon you, he draws his own blade from its night-black
scabbard...

~
  This young man's scarred chest is covered by a thick, leather apron.  He
wears his hair short, and occasionally mutters under his breath as a stray
spark lands upon his exposed skin.  He meticulously works at a piece of molten
metal, and generally tosses it back into the flames with a few muffled curses.

from the likelihood of burns.  A thin coat of sweat gleams upon his chiseled

up weakly at you and mutters, "If you aren't one of them, then kill me and
put me out of my Phaet-Damned misery," his breathing is labored as he
continues, "you have to stop them...they've sent someone to kill Khate."

to the outlaw's cavernous camp.  His eyes are shifty and crackle with a
fanatical intensity, and his dirty fingers are hooked like talons.

An outlaw guard~
A dangerous looking dwarf screams in rage as he sees you.
~
  The dwarf bellows in rage to his companions who come rushing to his defense.
Then turning to you, he runs a calloused thumb along his curved dagger and
grins with a smile of rotting teeth.  Grime and filth cover his greasy skin.
His political allegiances have forced him to live in fetid conditions.  Perhaps
your purse can help to ameliorate some of his discomfort.

fluid motion, his sword has been drawn from the scabbard at his back and he
has stepped into the space separating you from his liege.  The left side

giant scout glirraen mountain~
A mountain giant scout~
A mountain giant is here, scouting out the surrounding area.
~
This giant is over twice the height of a man, and his body
seems to almost be carved out of rock.  His eyes stare down
with almost an impenetrable anger at any trespassers, and
his long black hair and beard billow up at the slightest 
hint of a breeze.  This giant lives in the mountains, and
is as home in them as a mountain goat.  It would probably
be unwise to try to best him on his own home ground, non-
withstanding his incredible size and power.

A large deer~
A large deer is grazing here.
~
This deer is lean, but healthy and its big brown eyes stare at you in
wonder, though not with total fear.  The deer seems to be perpetually
grazing on the mountain, because the food isn't as abundant as it is
down on the plains.  It looks to be in perfect shape however, and could
probably outrun you easily if it had to.

A hill giant scout~
A hill giant is here, scouting out the surrounding area.
~
This giant is huge, easily standing almost twice as high
as a man.  He is muscular and looks to almost be carved
out of the earth, because of his brown skin.  His eyes
are dark and menacing, and it looks as if he could easily
deal with any kind of trespasser to his home.  His long
brown hair and beard are knotted into braids, which hang
loosely wherever they fall.  He is truly not a being to
be crossed.

~
This large female hill giant is easily almost twice as 
tall as a man, and she looks like she was carved from 
the earth itself, due to her dark brown complexion.  She
has a certain rugged charm, but she looks angry at the
intrusion into her home.  Giants are not well known for
their hospitality, and you might have overstayed yours
already.  Her long brown hair is tied into a ponytail, 
and she looks like she is ready to battle.

to widen and increase the caves of Gartome, the giant

her sweat streaked face is almost pretty in the muddy

Though this hill giant is a child, he easily stands almost as 
tall as a man.  His hair is long and unruly, and he looks at 
you with amazement and curiosity.  There are not many female 
giants born in Gartome, which is how the population has always 
been so low, but there are plenty of male giant children here, 
who will all grow up to be giant warriors in a few years.  
Though this child is small, he is as strong as two men, and can 
be a fierce fighter if provoked.

The spirit of an ancient hill giant leader~
The spirit of an ancient tribe leader floats here, damning you with its presence.
~
The giants revere ancient leaders, and sometimes those leaders come back
from beyond the grave to watch over their tribes.  This leader was a
particularly powerful one, and his image is more sharp than many of the
spirits.  You can tell that he was once a huge giant, almost three times
as tall as a man, and that his body seemed to be cut from the surrounding
earth itself.  He has a symbol on his ghostly forehead that reads 'Cairn', 
when roughly translated into the common tongue, which must be the name of
his particular tribe.  Even dead, he exudes great power, and he is not
pleased to see outsiders in the area he protects.

giant you have ever seen, and his massive muscles ripple at any movement.
He hates trespassers to his home, and will not tolerate them.  His skin
is the color of the richest earth, and his long brown hair is tinted with
golden strands, the same as his beard.  He wears a perpetual snarl, having
had spent most of his life in warfare.

Its shoulders easily stand a head above you, and its long tail swishes
violently in the air.  It has huge claws which paw at the earth, and
its beak gleams in the light as this griffin screeches its rage at you
in a booming wail.  Its wings buffet you as it flaps them at you, and
its muscles bunch under its skin as it prepares to pounce.

battle scars are numerous.  He towers above you, looking as if he was
made of a rich earth, and his muscles quiver as he looks into your
eye.  He is a hunter, and perhaps he thinks that you are the prey that
he has been seeking.  His long brown hair and beard is braided to keep
them out of his face, and he looks menacing as he licks his lips.

This giant is a halfbreed, but he is so filthy that you
can't tell what kind of giant he might be.  He is totally
insane, and his eyes, while showing the light of life, show
no signs of intelligence or understanding.  His hair and 
beard are totally dirty and matted, with twigs and leaves
caught in them, and it is a mess that almost totally hides
his face.  The giants value their families though, so this
giant will always have a home among his brethren.  They
treat him kindly, even though he is insane, and could be
dangerous with his almost inhuman strength.

and looks to be very old, which is rare with such a warlike race of

A giant slave~
A mindless sunken-eyed giant is lumbering towards you.
~
Often giants of other tribes are captured and put to work for
those that captured them.  This is no different in Gartome.
Though giants do not fight amongst themselves as a rule, there
are often skirmishes between tribes.  When a giant is captured,
he or she is stripped of clan name, and lives in servitude for
exactly a year and a day before being let loose to return with
honor to their clan.  Until that time however, they are made to
perform menial tasks, and can never raise their arms in violence
while they are slaves.

earth itself.  He has a symbol on his ghostly forehead that reads 'Vaowin', 
when roughly translated into the common tongue, which must be the name of
his particular tribe.  Even dead, he exudes great power, and he is not
pleased to see outsiders in the area he protects.

does not get along with most of her children, with the exception of Lucretia,
who she visits often.  She seems to be almost jealous of her daughter's ability

Sarka Lugosz is Boris's younger brother, and in life he was always jealous of his
brother's position as patriarch of the family.  In their current condition however,
Sarka schemes to take the family over and become its patriarch.  The vampirism
has given him the courage he never had before.  Sarka likes rich things, and his
clothes and mannerisms reflect this.  Scented oils are rubbed into his olive skin,
and his brown eyes glow softly from under a wreath of golden hair.  His decadent
clothing recalls an age gone by, and he carries a perpetual sneer on his face for
anyone who he doesn't consider to be worthy of his time.

An old wolf~
An old white wolf stands here, growling at your intrusion into his den.

This old, white wolf is huge, almost as big as a man.  Its white fur bristles whenever
intruders come into its territory.  Perhaps this used to be a member of the Lugosz
family that liked being a wolf, or who could never change back from the wolf form to
the human form.  Whatever it is, it is ancient.

new power.  He doesn't oppose his father's rule, but neither does he fully support it.
He is a short, dark young man with serious blue eyes, and he loves to read.  He has 
been studying what has happened to the family, and seeing if it is reversible.  He
does not want to be like this for the rest of eternity, but while he is, he is a
full member of the Lugosz clan.

his father, is glad of their "deaths" and subsequent rebirth, and he lives his
undeath to the fullest.  The other family members are afraid of him, for just
cause.  He is very dangerous.

A powerful, middle-aged man stands here, waiting to strike you down.
~
Boris Lugosz is the patriarch of the Lugosz family.  His family members don't
know how he originally became a vampire, and he won't tell.  He slowly infected
his family with vampirism over the years, until the whole family "died".  They
then let their mansion grow old and become a ruin, to throw suspicion off of
their fates.  It has only been recently that Boris has led his family back to
claim their home once again.  This powerful, dark haired man is pure evil, and
he will do anything to keep intruders from his home.

It looks as if it is, but they've been dead for well over one hundred years.  You
have heard of the last surviving member being Janor Lugosz, cousin to Boris
Lugosz, the patriarch of the family, but how could he still be alive, after all
of these years?

green that you are reminded of being in a forest.  Her lush figure hasn't

     Standing at six foot tall, Amadan towers over most except for the
Half-Giants of the land. When one stares into her violet eyes, it's almost
hypnotic; forcing you to do things you may or may not want to do. Her long
blonde hair flows down her back, and frames her face. Her most striking feature,
asides from her pale skin, would be the ivory white fangs protruding from
beneath her full red lips. Her attire is befitting of the Second Disciple of
Paghk; a tattoo of a vulture on each arm, and every bit of armor on her body
bears a symbol of Paghk in some way, be it his holy symbol or his harbinger,
the vulture.

Two bright, black eyes stare out of the mess of a face, however, and
a black, gaping maw that can only be a mouth seems to scream out
soundlessly, in some kind of perpetual agony.  If it ever was human,
then this wax-like man has suffered greatly, both during its life, and
its afterlife.

~
What you first took to be a piece of tattered cloth seems to move on
its own, and resembles a hooded robe.  It is dark and almost indistinct,
until you see the two, red glowing orbs shining forth from under the
tattered cloth.  These orbs shine with an awful malevolence, and the
robe seems to flutter in the nonexistent breeze every time they grow
brighter.  This thing floats about four feet off of the ground, and emits
a sound that is similar to a high pitched keening.  There is also a smell
of dark, musty air surrounding this figure, as if it carries the stench of
the grave with it.

dead eyes and a dark gap of a mouth.  This thing smells moldy, like 
something ancient, and its skeletal hands, which stick out of tattered

It was once a very huge spider, judging from the size of its skeleton, but
it has since died.  Unfortunately, it still moves its skeletal frame in some
sort of undead existence.  Its eyes glow brightly with malignance, and its
fangs clatter noisily together as the enormous skeleton senses living
tissue nearby.  It doesn't look as if it eats anymore, but some habits 
probably die hard, even in the afterlife.

there is nothing delicate looking about this undead monstrosity.  It sways
rhythmically on the back part of its body, its broad, white skull shifting 
back and forth.  It stares with white, bright eyes, and its mouth opens to 
reveal two very large fangs that still seek flesh, even after its death.  It 
still moves quickly, despite its lack of life, and its glowing eyes still 
shine with cunning.

doesn't mean that it still can't function.  This corpse walks and guards 
its home, even though it is dead.  The creature's skin has all but decayed
off of its skeleton, and the whiteness of bone shows through its tattered 
flesh in many places.  The eyes are still blazing with hatred, however.  
Not even death could stop that.  It moves more slowly, but this corpse 
is no less deadly now that it was alive.

~
This spider is huge, and you can only imagine how much larger it was when
it was alive.  Even a little withered and shrunken by death, this thing is still 
as big as a small pony.  The fur on its body is patchy and matted, and at times 
you can see the white of a bone shining through the hair, but it still looks 
powerful enough to make short work out of you.  Its long fangs clatter 
together, as it limps around on its withered eight legs.

and deep wrinkles running over his exposed flesh.  His mouth is slightly
open, and there is no breathing motion in his thin, bony chest.  His hair
is thin and wild, and he has long claws at the end of his bony fingers.  He
wears what once might have been considered priestly robes, but they are
so old and tattered now, that they are just rags.  His eyes glow with an evil
light, however, making him seem much more like a living corpse.

missing arms, legs, heads, or hands, but they still move around, albeit
much more slowly than they used to.  They still exist, however, in their
undead state.

These things are straight out of children's tales, the frighteners, the haints
that will come and take you away.  They are just as imposing now as they
were when you first probably heard the stories.  Tall, dark figures, thin
inside their blackened shrouds as they float off of the ground.  You can 
see two dead eyes staring from deep inside sunken faces, and long, spectral
hands hang from the tattered sleeves of their robes.  You can smell a moist,
earthy smell coming from them.

He is still garbed in remnants of priestly robes, although they are now almost
completely tattered and discolored.  His body is much the same way, both
tattered, and green with mold, as he walks stiffly through the afterlife, maybe
still searching for converts.  His eyes are glassy and vacant, and his mouth
is agape and slack.  His wisps of hair hang wildly from his decaying head,
and every so often, small pieces of his skin fall to the ground, often revealing
the whiteness of bone.

and can hear the clacking together of the spider's fangs when something
attracts its interest.  It would also look to be deceptively quick, with its
long, fuzzy legs skittering over the ground.  Its huge abdomen hangs
low between its legs, near the ground, throbbing with life.

abdomen is sleek and long, with even its fur looking smooth.  It has long, 
slender legs which look to propel it at great speeds across the ground, and
it has a large, diamond shaped white patch on the top of its black back.
It almost looks oily as it moves, oily and silent.

This little man seems impossibly old, more ancient than any living
human you've ever seen.  Deep wrinkles line his face, and travel
down his body, which can be easily seen through the tattered hides,
beads, and feathers he wears.  His wispy thin white hair frames his
skull like a nimbus, as wild and spry as he seems to be.  His mouth
is toothless, but his eyes still burn brightly as he shakes his curse
markers around.  He is well versed in a magic not seen in Entia 
anymore, a magic of spirits and curses.  His toothless maw is open
in a perpetual grin whenever his wizened claws of hands shake the
curse markers, and he mumbles in a low, unintelligible voice.

This creature looks like some kind of abomination of nature.  It's hard 
to even speculate how goblins and spiders could have offspring, but
the evidence stands in front of you.  These ugly creatures have the 
upper torsos of goblins, with their powerfully muscled arms, and wide
faces with fanged mouths and red eyes.  Their lower bodies, however,
favor their spider sires, with the large, black furry abdomens, and the
eight bristly legs that hold them about six feet off the ground.  The
ferocity of goblins has been mixed with the cunning of spiders, making
this thing even more deadly.

This beast is not fully a snake, neither is it fully a dragon.  There are
very few Wyrms left in existence in the world, and this is a very large
specimen.  It has the long, sinuous body of a serpent, but is much
larger.  It has large spine ridges going down half of its mottled back,
and has four smallish, but functional legs positioned under its body.
Its tail whips back and forth expectantly, and looks dangerous.  Its
black and beady eyes shine forth under a heavy brow, and above a
gaping maw of sharp teeth.  It almost seems to blend into the rocky
hole it lives in, and it looks angry at being disturbed.

This big thing is hard to describe when first seen.  It's horrific, there is
no doubt about that, but its features don't really stand out.  Its overall
effect, however, is terrifying.  It is large and black, which does much
to hide its features.  Large, yellow eyes rest above a huge, fanged mouth,
in which a red tongue flicks out from in between long, sharp teeth, every
so often.  It is heavily muscled, and stands on thick, powerful legs.  It
has huge hands, and ragged nails jut from each finger.  It looks vaguely
bestial, but there seems to be some kind of intelligence in its cold eyes.

from under its square face and vicious mouth, giving it a very bestial
appearance.  It has broad hands and feet, and looks heavily muscled.
It barks in some guttural tongue occasionally as it half walks, half
lopes along the ground, and although the look in its eyes is dim, you
don't doubt that this thing could break rock with its bare hands.

eyes light up in the same mean and devious ways as its cousins,
however, and it seems to be just as deadly.

Perhaps some rogue treant, or some druid that went to live among
the jungle plants.  Whatever it was, it's now a large being composed
of vegetable matter.  Its eyes are red, and shine with some kind of
awareness, but it's hard to say if any intelligence is still there.

brow.  A long tongue flicks out every so often, tasting the air, and

anaconda huge snake~
An anaconda~
A huge log moves here, and you realize that it's actually a snake.
~
Its mottled brown, scaly skin helps it to hide among the swamps
and jungles it calls home, hiding its huge bulk completely, or
making it look like some fallen log.  It is huge, at least fifty to
sixty feet long, with its body as wide as a large tree trunk.  Its
head is the size of a small child, and cold, dark eyes peer out 
from under the brow on its head.  The end of its tail twines every
so often, and a large tongue pokes lazily out from its mouth every
so often to taste the air.

spiderling huge leader~
A huge spiderling~
A spiderling wearing feathers and beads yammers here in a foreign tongue.
~
This spiderling is a particularly large member of its species, and that,
along with the fact that it wears many cheap beads and feathers, makes
you think that it may be some kind of leader.  Its broad face and red 
eyes are particularly cruel, and its muscled arms flex as its abdomen
pulses with life.  Its eight legs carry it quickly over the ground, and it
looks very hungry.

spider huge leader~
A huge spider~
An absolutely gigantic spider chitters angrily at you here.
~
This spider is one of the largest you have ever seen, and it is easy
to believe that it is some kind of sire to its species.  Its many eyes
gaze out coldly from a fuzzy head as big as a small child, and its
huge abdomen throbs with some kind of life.  It has huge fangs
that look more like tusks, and its huge legs hold it off the ground,
just above you.

goblinoid huge leader~
A huge goblinoid~
A huge goblinoid being stands here, with a snarl on its face.
~
From its various feathers, beads, and clothing, you can see that
this thing leads the goblinoids in the area; that, and the fact that
it is twice as large as its brethren.  It is nearly the size of a human
male, and looks as if it knows how to fight.  The evil look from
its red eyes, and the sneering lips, revealing sharp teeth, tell you
that it's ready for one also.  It is well muscled, with a broad face,
and flowing hair that hangs down from the back of its head.

horror supreme gigantic being~
A supreme horror~
A gigantic being stands before you, waiting to tear you from limb to limb.
~
It is gigantic, whatever it is.  It stands a full fifteen feet tall, black and very
imposing.  Bright yellow eyes glow forth from a mysteriously indistinct
body, and large fangs are visible hanging from an opened mouth.  It is wide,
with heavy arms and legs, and its hands are large, with long nails hanging 
from each finger.  It is furry, or perhaps oily, and smells like dead things.
It is hard to see, and seems to be able to hide easily, but it looks to be fast; 
fast and very dangerous.

commander man fort soldier~
The fort commander~
A tall man stands here, swaying slightly as he rubs his haggard face.
~
He is a tall man, broad in the shoulders and muscled, though there is the
beginning of a belly showing.  He could be considered handsome with
sandy blond hair and piercing blue eyes, if his face weren't so haggard
and unshaved.  Though it looks like he was born a soldier, it looks as if
that garb now fits him uncomfortably.  His insignia marks him as the
commander of the fort, but it looks as if making hard decisions is now
getting the better of him.  His broad, muscled hands look as if they can
remember how to handle a weapon, however, and every so often he 
still narrows his eyes, and a dangerous glint will show.

lieutenant man fort soldier~
A young lieutenant~
A young man stands here, all spit and polished.
~
This man is dressed in rigid accordance to military dress codes, so you
can see right away that he is a lieutenant.  His bright and lively green eyes
shine from a young face that still has the blush of youth upon it.  His
blond hair is cut short to his skull, and he wears his full uniform, no
matter how hot it might get.  He is tall, but still a bit gangly and uneven.
He looks to be truly devoted to his duty, even though you have a feeling
that he's never really been tested.

sergeant man fort soldier~
An old sergeant~
An old man stands here, looking like he could tear you apart.
~
This man is a grizzled veteran of many a skirmish in many parts of the
world, and his gruff countenance and harsh eyes confirm it.  His body is
laced with scars, particularly the one that runs from under his short, white
hair, and follows the contours of his face, ending just short of his chin.  
He is short, but heavily muscled.  If anyone could take care of himself,
you figure that this man could.

A man is here, guarding the fort he is assigned to protect.
~
He is dedicated to protecting this fort from intruders, and to protecting 
the Kingdoms of the North.  The jungles of Darkun Moss are hot and
dirty, however, and he is not always in full uniform.  His duties and 
professionalism never suffer though, and he looks like he could be a
tough opponent to almost any enemy.

An old wizard~
An old man stands here, swaying and looking drunk.
~
Either this man is old, or his obvious drunkenness has aged him before
his time.  He is still a bit pudgy, though his limbs are thin, and he is
bowed when he walks around.  Wispy strands of white hair frame his
round, wrinkled face, and his rheumy eyes blink slowly as he looks
around himself every so often.  His clothes are stained and dirty, and
he often mumbles things under his breath, but you could swear that
sometimes his eyes look more sober than you thought.  He looks
thoroughly disreputable, but it seems that he's some kind of peddler
of wares.

A citizen~
A man walks here, on some kind of errand.
~
He chooses to live in the fort of Darkun Moss for many reasons.  He has
family here, certainly, and wants to be close to them.  He is also a sort
of pioneer, wanting to tame the harsh land outside of the fort.  He is just
waiting for the right moment to try.  He hopes that someone will help
to clear out the land so he and his family can start a farm.  He is large
and well defined, but in all, he's just a regular man trying to make it in
the world.

She might not like the life in the fort and the danger that lurks outside,
but she supports her family and lives here anyway.  Like many others, she
left her children behind with other relatives, until some safety at Darkun
Moss could be guaranteed, or until she and her family were able to leave
it completely.  She misses the children, but she has plenty of other things
to worry about.

The smith~
A huge man works here, repairing all kinds of things.
~
The blacksmith has come to town to make a name for himself.  Where 
else but in an area of hard weapon and armor use, can he get this much
business?  He does not like the area of Darkun Moss, but he likes the
challenge of the business it brings him.  He is a huge man, with arms as
thick as a normal man's thighs.  His hair is cut short for the hot work,
and his broad face is smudged with dirt and soot from the hot forge.  He
wears a broad leather apron at all times, to protect himself from the 
sparks of the forge, where he hammers out repairs to many items.  His
legs are thick and planted wide, to provide him with the most leverage
he can get.

He is a big, jolly looking man, but he is a shrewd business man.  He 
came to Darkun Moss to help the citizens of the fort with their needs,
and he has been well rewarded.  He can't say that he likes the heat
or the things out in the jungle, but he is pleased with the money he
has been earning.  And, in a few years, he can retire.  He is a large
man, with bright blue eyes and a balding pate.  He doesn't look it, 
but he can take care of himself.

is great evil and great temptation in a place like this, and the priest is
here to help combat it.  He is an older man, with black hair turned
mostly gray by now, and with lines starting to mark his face.  His hazel
eyes are kindly however, and he has helped many people in pain and
trouble.  He views this place as a challenge, one that he is willing to
accept in the name of Phaet, the God over all.

He is totally and fearlessly dedicated to the protection of the fort at
Darkun Moss.  He will defend it with his life. He has risen above 
the ranks of the ordinary guard, and has been charged with the
safety and protection of the inhabitants of the fort.  He must be able
to disregard his own safety, and think only of the welfare of the
people that live in the fort.

Moss and help with the danger in the jungle.  The bad ones either
leave immediately upon learning how dangerous it is, or die from 
some stupid mistake.  The goods ones hire on with either the fort, or
the shopkeepers or citizens.  It's a hard life, but they are willing to
live it.  They are all tall, broad men, usually bristling with armor and
weapons, which are about all they own.

These men aren't like mercenaries.  They have too much free will to
be tied down by an employer.  They are usually loners who roam the
world looking for some kind of adventure and treasure, hoping to 
increase their fortune and sate their wanderlust.  Like mercenaries,
however, they are big men that bristle with armor and weapons, which
they find on their travels.  Ask any of them about dragons, and almost
to a man they have a story about fighting one.

that are as long as a child's arm.  Its black eyes glare coldly around it, and
it lashes its tail back and forth angrily, trying to get back into the lagoon.

of the fort, perhaps this place has unique properties making it ideal to further
the study of his art.  He looks up as you walk in.

She is quite arguably the most beautiful sylvan maiden there is. Her long locks
of platinum blond hair are carefully braided and draped over her shoulder. Silk
strands and small silver accents hold it in place. Her milk white skin looks to
be softer than anything you've ever touched and she seems to show no fear.  Her
very presence feels magical and it seems as if everything around her glitters
and shimmers.  As she continues her hymn, her voice seems almost angelic as it

characteristic stooped posture, but his stench gives him away long before you

forehead and simian brow. His nose appears more like a snout, which is rather
common amongst orcs.

ceasing.

a tree in half with a single bite.  Its brown and yellow body is covered in a 
tough chitinous carapace, and it skitters about on six slender legs. Two large
glistening black eyes rest just below its sensitive antennae.

tall height has caused his spine to curl forward in an unhealthy-looking
hunch. Drool runs down his face as his razor sharp teeth jut out of his
mouth, preventing him from being able to close his lips. He bears the red
and black tabard of the Tarr, and wields a long, curved dagger.
