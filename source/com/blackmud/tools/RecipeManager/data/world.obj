Nameless~
    The object consists of a beautiful blue gem of some sort suspended above a
small flat piece of marble by a finely crafted frame of gold.  The palm-sized
jewel looks a bit like a stylized eye, with the gem at the center being the iris.
Every time you concentrate on the jewel, it seems to glow with a soft blue aura.
    Further inspection reveals a tiny insignia in the corner of the marble base;
it appears to be the symbol of a crossed looking glass and dagger.  There is also
a short inscription on the opposite corner of the base, but it is written in a
language that you do not understand.

This story begins a long time ago, long before humankind ever set foot on the 
great continent of Balric. Here, during the reign of High Eldar Denos-aya, a 
young woman known as Yin-aya gave birth to her first child. Yin-aya was the 
great-granddaughter of the High Eldar himself and following the ancient elven 
tradition of the first of the 8th generation, Yin-ara's child was to be 
dedicated to the creator and would one day don the robes of a cleric. The child, 
a healthy elven girl was given the name of Sur-aya, which means, "Path of One" 
in elven language. Little did Yin-ara know that the name would ring truth and 
shake the very foundations of the little child's destiny.
~
E
two page-two page2 2~
Sur-aya grew up to be a typical elven child - inquisitive, active and having a 
great love for nature. Like all elves, she would develop a strong bond with her 
natural surroundings and foster a close affinity with all living creatures. 
Unlike most elves, she loved to spend her time indoors, reading most if not all 
of the literature, scrolls and religious text written about the creator.  Now the 
average lifespan on any given elf is roughly 400 years and the age where an elf 
would reach adolescence is about the first 40 years of that. It was during that 
coming of age, where Sur-aya was accepted into the circle of the clerics of Phaet. 
There she served for a great many years.
~
E
three page-three page3 3~
A hundred years later, humankind landed on the continent of Balric and changed the 
course of Sur-aya's life forever... Eventually, the humans encroached on elven 
land. Desecrating elven sacred grounds and destroying the natural resources, the 
elves grew angry and threatened. Soon, a group of Arch-Magi began to stir up the 
anti-human sentiments amongst the elvenkin.  Sur-aya, now a High Priestess and 
several Elven Eldar Cardinals stood firmly against this but to no avail. Thus began 
the first war of dominance... The Clerics of Phaet did what they could to prevent 
the genocide of humankind, imploring the warrior elves to capture rather than kill 
the humans. Sur-aya, helped the human slaves as much she could. Caring for them and 
healing those with grievous wounds. She felt compassion and love for these fellow 
worshippers of Phaet. Not everyone shared her views. The more xenomorphic elves 
began to snub and chide her. She was slowly becoming an outcast even amongst her 
own brethren.
~
E
four page-four page4 4~
Sur-aya petitioned daily to Phaet, asking for the creator to impart wisdom to the 
ruling class of elves. To show them the error of their ways, and that this was not 
the way. Day after day for nearly a decade, she faithfully prayed to the Creator 
but to no avail. The Ruling Class of elves grew more arrogant in their ways, and 
issued the 'Procreation Proclamation'. The Clerics by now had either given up or 
had joined the ranks of the Ruling Class in their distrust of Humankind.  Sur-aya 
stood alone, as she objected to this proclamation. But she was like a tiny pebble 
in an inevitable sea of hatred. The humans then staged a series of protest, which 
grew in strength and eventually became a revolution. They sought to overthrow their 
masters. And they did after five long years of war. The elves made their last stand 
in their greatest capitol, Rac Semder. Despite the circumstances, Sur-aya was still 
pleading for peace and tolerance. As a result, she was branded a traitor, and was 
highly distrusted. It was only because of her bloodline, that she was spared the 
humiliation of exile.
~
E
five page-five page5 5~
Eventually Rac Semder fell, and Sur-aya was captured by the humans. She continued 
her protests and call to peace even in the hands of the brutal humans. Her fellow 
elves shunned her, and the humans ridiculed her. She pressed for many, many years. 
Sur-aya, was later sold to a noble family to serve as an elven slave.  A faithful 
servant, Sur-aya became. And trusted by the family. Recognizing that she was of 
good education, the family also asked her to teach their son about the great history 
of Balric, the arts and language of the elves. Sur-aya also taught this young man 
about peace, tolerance and of Phaet. The young man's name was Kieran De Lucian. And 
with him, he would pass on the teachings of Sur-aya.

Throughout history, people have spoken often of strange dreams that seem more fearful     
then the worst living nightmare.  Demons, they call them.  The twisted fears of our       
worst flights of imagination, but they are very real.  Long, long ago Demons dwelled       
upon the surface of our lands, contending with the evolving races for survival.  They       
were blood thirsty, cruel, and heartless; killing on whim or fancy.  They destroyed         
for pleasure, and few could stand against their combined Hordes.  As they grew in           
numbers, the benign Gods who favor Phaet's Creation took matters into their own hands,          
and banished the Demon Hordes to a realm of darkness in an effort to preserve Creation.        
When the dreaded Hordes were within the darkness, the portals to the ether world were           
sealed by the Gods, and the Demons were left to dwell, alone with their hunger for             
blood and desires for power.  Out of pity for the species, as they too were of Creation,       
one was left to dwell in the Immortal realm, alone and in solitude, unable to mate and           
reproduce.  Shrouded in misery and longing, he was condemned to live for eternity, and 
in spiteful rage against his captors, the Immortal demon known as Ezekol uses what power
he yet commands to taunt and manipulate the mortal races.  The protector Gods do not seem
to interfere with the petty demons antics.  Perhaps they feel his eternal severance is
punishment enough.  Forever cut off from his kin and kind, stuck in a realm of darkness
and light, space and time, alone and without hope from the early history of Entia.  And 
there he yet dwells; guarding the lost knowledge of the Demon race.

		The Journal of Harram R'ethillen
*
I am not pleased with the decision of the Council.  "The desert must be watched and we 
have chosen you to be its guardian."  They attempt to make this nightmare sound a great 
honor when in fact it is the nightmare I state it to be.  I am condemned to spend the 
next two hundred years of my youth in blistering heat and blaring sun.  And for what?  
To watch, they say.  But they wouldn't say what or who I am to watch.  So here I am 
preparing for my journey into the desert, to my new home within the trading outpost of 
Casceras.  I resent the tower with a passion for this slight against me.  The desert!  
Of all places it is the last for a great mage of my standing!  But I must not protest 
to the Council.  If I wish to ever be granted leeway in my studies of our universe then 
I must comply with their wishes.. At least with the traders coming and going I will have 
access to news of my home.
~
E
two page-two page2 2~
The arguments continue among the crotchety old men in the Tower.  Sometimes I think they 
avoid logic for the sheer pleasure of yelling at each other for weeks on end.  If only I
could find some proof tying our powers to the Heavens.  If only I wasn't stuck in this 
accursed outpost instead of back at my study within the Towers of our glorious home.  
Curse this blasted sand!  Curse this heat, and curse the stinking cattle traders and their 
stinking cattle too!
~
E
three page-three page3 3~
Another day in this heat and my brains are going to end up as baked as the bread on my 
table.  I received a scroll from the Tower today and it's content troubles me deeply.  
"Danger comes from across the sea and threatens our existence."  Puzzling indeed.  Be 
patient, sit tight, they'll send another scroll when their Seers divine more.
~
E
four page-four page4 4~
These people are strong, but their knowledge of magic is rudimentary at best.  This must 
be the danger from across the sea the Tower spoke of, yet I fail to see how such an ignorant 
race could pose a threat to our society.
~
E
five page-five page5 5~
There are many wild magiks in the universe, some known and many not, though they were not 
meant to be wielded by mere mortals in this age.  It is clear to me now that we lack the 
necessary knowledge and understanding to harness their unpredictable powers.  The 
destruction of my family and home has taught me this, though the knowledge is small 
compensation for their loss.

one page-one page1 1~
Necromancy is best defined as the conjuration of dead spirits.   This talent can be used for a 
variety of tasks, though the most frequent uses include divination of the future, revelation of 
the past, and exerting personal control over the manifest spirit.  To expound on the concept, we 
will go into detail about these three main topics, and the effects they can have on the conjurer.
~
E
two page-two page2 2~
Divination:
To divine something is to use insight, perception, and interpretation of information to foretell 
the future.  Using the dead to this end is practical as more then once spirits have revealed to 
their conjurer that the Otherworld does not operate in similar vein to the mortal plane, and have 
shown us that they have some small access to knowledge of current and future events.  
*
The use of spirits for this purpose can be physically and mentally taxing, the extent of which is 
dependent on how long the conjurer is in contact with the spirit.  Although no deaths have been 
associated with the practice, extended periods of contact with spirits has been noted to frequently 
cause the conjurer to fall into an unconscious and unresponsive state for many days after.
~
E
three page-three page3 3~
Revelation:
A revelation is often seen as an enlightening or astonishing disclosure.  Often revelations come 
in the way of vital information needed to clarify an event or situation.  The practical ends of 
using conjured spirits for revelation are obvious when considering their implicit knowledge and 
involvement in their past lives.  If one wished to know the daily operations of a smithy in 
Dawnspasture, they have but to find the bones of the smith and summon its spirit to speak with.
*
The known effects of Revelation on the conjurer have, to date, been identical to that of Divination.
~
E
four page-four page4 4~
Control:
To exert control over a conjured spirit is to bind the ethereal spirit to the physical world for a 
short period of time, during which the conjurer has complete control over the physical manifestation.  
When a spirit is bound to form, it loses all previous skill, knowledge, feeling, and emotion.  In 
essence, it becomes a mindless zombie at the command of the conjurer.  There are no real power 
advantages to binding a spirit in physical form, as the forms are weak and powerless.  This form of 
Necromancy is most often used as a token amusement on the part of the conjurer, and to perform menial 
tasks the conjurer doesn't wish to do themselves.
*
There are no known effects to this practice that could be marked as dangerous to the conjurer.

Within the world there exists the form and the formless.  The fact and the idea, the limited 
and the endless.  It is within these we find dream, desire, hope, and fear.  In the shadowed 
realms between the known and the unknown lies the grey regions of possibility.  Of fate, 
chance, and destiny.  
~
E
two page-two page2 2~
Rumor speaks clearly more often then not the greatest truths of the multi-verse.  Whispered 
conversations in a dimly lit tavern, a chance meeting between two strangers, or a parchment 
slipped under your chamber door.  In such ways do we learn of the unspoken, the unnamed, the 
unknown.  Sometimes these shadows walk among our desires and nightmares, other times they walk 
amongst our dead ghosts, buried long since.  But once in a while these shadows walk amongst us 
as the living.  Tales of untold might; a dwarf who slew a thousand foes single handedly.  
Legends of magic in which a Mage created a portal to a universe of men riding on metal creatures.  
~
E
three page-three page3 3~
There exists in Entia an age old myth of a secret organization, formed by the first sentient 
mortals long ago to protect creation.  They foreswore all oaths of allegiance to both man and 
mortal, and chose instead to give service to the universe itself, serving all Gods and yet None.  
As the story goes, the group began as a small clan that grew to prominence and recognition.  They 
built a tower within the city of Jq’Demes and gathered into it all the books, tomes, scrolls, and 
scriptures the world had ever produced.  Over the passage of time and through the wars of the 
mortal races, the city fell to ruin, and with it the organization also fell.  The name of the group 
was lost with their library and wealth of knowledge, but tales are told from time to time that the 
organization still runs strong in the world.  
~
E
four page-four page4 4~
It is said they meet in secret to guide and watch over the lands, keeping themselves in the shadows 
to manipulate without the impressions of power.  Some say the organization aims for their own glory, 
that someday they'll use their accumulated influence to overthrow the kingdoms.  Others say they are 
our guardians and protectors against the greatest evils of the realms, while the wise simply laugh 
and pass the rumors off as nothing more then flights of fancy of simple minds.  From time to time, a 
curious adventurer has gone off in search of the greater knowledge, chasing rumor and hearsay in 
circles across the length and breadth of the lands.  Any who've returned have done so empty handed, 
and some have never returned at all.

The group of stars known as the Plow has long been a symbol of hard work and honesty.  
*
The group of stars known as The Mother is a symbol of fertility and new life.
*
Throughout the year in the Middle sky there is a large empty spot in the night sky.  Since it is 
always visible and no star has ever been seen within it, the place is referred to as Nixils Eye.
*
The group of stars known as The Scythe is often seen as a symbol of death, and holds great relevance 
for Necromancers.
*
The group of stars known as The Anvil is a symbol of strength, and is viewed by the Dwarves as a sacred 
place where good spirits go after death.
*
The group of stars known as The Archer is a symbol of skill and dedication, and bears great significance 
to the Elves of the north lands.

Though unconventional at best, this paper is an attempt to immortalize 
my view of what we refer to as "magic".
				*
It is largely believed magic is a skill any man, woman, or child can learn.  
This, I say, is wrong.  I believe the power we call magic is actually a 
natural energy of the universe, and not something so simple as a learned 
skill.  This is not to say that it doesn't take skill to learn to control 
this energy, but that it's not a force just anyone can learn to control.
				*
I believe this energy is in, around, and part of everything, but not 
everyone.  I believe it is a conscious force that chooses its bearers, and 
dispenses its gift as it sees fit.

~
E
1 Phaet~
  Phaet is, and has always been.  To ponder the essence of the supreme being
more than that borders upon heresy.
  At the dawn of time though, Phaet began to experience a great loneliness.
he was the sole being within all the planes, and as such, he created companions
for himself.  The first of these companions was Nixil, the rest, were the
remainder of our pantheon.
  Recognizing the need for a kingdom, Phaet and the other gods created the
material world, but a great jealousy began to fill Nixil's heart, and he
gradually became more and more corrupt.  As Phaet and his children worked to
create the material world, Nixil began working to destroy it, his hatred for
the humanoid races knew almost no bounds...it was then that he became the
lord of darkness.

~
E
2 nixil banishment~
  Recognizing that something must be done about his ill-begotten son, Phaet
endeavored to destroy Nixil, but the dark one had become far too powerful,
and Phaet's powers had lessened tremendously.  As such, the most Phaet could
do to the foul Nixil was banishment.
  Nixil was thrust headlong into the void known only as "the black space."
No longer capable of getting to the gods' realms of Aleen, he was weakened
terribly.  The glorious lord Phaet saved us from Nixil's direct destruction,
but Nixil began to search for other methods of spreading his evil.
 
~
E
3 coming sanaluth~
  Nixil scoured the planes for a son of his own, and at last, found an
innocent babe still within his mother's womb.  Sensing that the unborn child
possessed the potential for ultimate power, Nixil began to communicate with
and corrupt the child even before its birth.
  Nixil named the child Sanaluth, and granted it a portion of his own power.
The corruption this must have caused within young Sanaluth's mind was total,
and the child's intellect began to grow at an uncanny speed.  By the time
Sanaluth was born, his mental capacity was far greater than any of the sages
of the land, no one knows the fate of Sanaluth's parents, but they must have
met a wretched demise...

1. The origins of Balric
2. The arrival of humans
3. The Elf-Human War

~
E
origins balric 1~
  Entia is possessed of many continents.  The one upon which we dwell is known
as Balric.  All of Balric's current races began here, save for the interloper
humans.
  The early days of Balric's races were generally peaceful.  The dwarves,
halflings, giants, gralner and mirlad lived simple existences as hunters and
gatherers, the elves, were far more advanced because of their capacity for
magic.  In general, the elves let the other races be, as none of the primitive
creatures posed any threat to the glories of the Elvish Nations.

~
E
arrival humans 2~
  Peace and harmony were known throughout Balric until the first humans began
setting foot upon the land.  Supposedly, they had fled their own continent
due to the ravages of war, (there are those who suggest that the dreaded
Sanaluth may have been the war's catalyst.)  Regardless of what the situations
were behind their arrival, the humans began to set up small colonies.
  The elves viewed the humans as bestial and stupid.  Capable of little more
than burden and toil, the elvish nations heeded the advice of their reigning
counsel of mages, and began to enslave the inferior humans.
  As more humans arrived, they were quickly subdued upon the shores, for many
years, the elves reigned supreme.  Ultimately though, the elves physiology
would prove their greatest foe.

~
E
war elf human 3~
  Although we elves live for upwards of three centuries, we may reproduce only
once every hundred years, and not until the second century of life.  In
contrast, the brutish humans mate with the propensity of rodents.  Recognizing
that we would soon be outnumbered by the humans, our race forbade our servants
from reproduction without the master's consent.
  Humans, (being base creatures who focus only on hedonism,) were furious
about this law.  Many of the human-slaves in the more remote villages began
to revolt, soon, this revolt transformed into open warfare.
  Now known as the "War of Dominance", the humans and elves clashed for almost
two hundred years.  At last, even our great magics couldn't save us. We were
outnumbered ten to one, and the foul humans began the darkest passage of
elvish history- our own enslavement.

3. The Time of Catastrophe

~
E
fall rac samdar 1~
  Perhaps the saddest day after the defeat of our people, was when we watched
the victorious humans claim our beautiful metropolis of Rac Samdar as their
own.  Where once the crest of the tree had flown over her battlements, now
lay the various flags of humanity.  Helpless to resist, we were forced to
serve humanity within what had once been our home.
  But our people are long-lived, and became stronger in the face of torment.
One day, we swore, humanity would taste our vengeance.

~
E
escape elves 2~
  While those of us in servitude within Rac Samdar were all but powerless,
our brethren in the outlying villages were capable of resistance.  Using
stealth as their ally, they would slit the human toremtor's throats while they
slept and flee to the plains of the north.  There, we became far more nomadic
then we had ever been before.
  Though it saddened us to do so, we eventually abandoned Rac Samdar.  Fleeing
from both our own capital and the human mecca of Galen, we waited and hid
until our numbers became enough.  When all our brethren who were able had
escaped, we began to launch guerilla warfare against our human tormentors.
  Our numbers had been decimated in our servitude, so that we could conquer
nothing more than the smallest human outposts and settlements.  Still, we
created our new capital of Lohm, and a group of our most elite warriors known
as the "Riders of Lohm" managed to defend it from those few humans who knew
of its existence.  Luckily for us, the humans would soon have greater matters
to concern themselves with...

~
E
time catastrophe 3~
  No one knows why the first catastrophes occurred, or where the foul hordes
appeared from.  What we do know is that cataclysm after cataclysm and war
after war began to ravage the lands.  From the west, the Tarr horde arose,
and rumors of Rac Samdar having fallen again reached us from the south.
Horrific monsters, once thought merely the stuff of children's tales wandered
the roads by night.  The heroic Riders managed to fend off most of the threat
toward Lohm.  It seemed, that the evil was concentrating mainly on the humans.
  Eventually, the human capitol of Galan fell beneath the horde's horrible
might.  A slaughter, less than a third of Galan's citizenry survived.  Among
them, was a remarkable noble-woman by the name of Maia Wrathchild.
  Meanwhile, the other races were falling to disease and plague, it was a
black time for Balric, and we began to wonder if we weren't witnessing the
beginnings of the end.

1. The Building of Makilor
2. Ran de Lucian
3. The World of Today

~
E
building makilor 1~
  With Galan's complete destruction, virtually nothing but stones stood where
the once vast capital had been.  Taking the remainder of her people northward,
Maia Wrathchild at last settled upon the shores of a great river as the site
of their new city.  She christened the new city, Makilor.
  Wary of the humans, and their new proximity to us, we retreated even more.
Where Lohm had once been at the center of the elven kingdom, it now stood
as a border-town.  Perhaps it was this that kept us from being conquered by
the hordes.  For as Galan had fallen, other cities slowly became conquered.
In the west, the outpost of Nera and the Principality of Kazrak fell, and
in the south, Tansar's small town of Denilos was conquered by strange
creatures.
  Wrathchild meanwhile, had married a lord named Stuart, and was several
months pregnant.  The building of Makilor was all ready well under way.

~
E
ran lucian 2~
  Slowly, Makilor was built.  Maia and Stuart became the parents to a baby
boy, who was named after his father.  Stuart the Second eventually married
as well, and carried on the tradition by naming his son Stuart the Third.
  Eventually, as is the way with all living things, Stuart III had a son as
well.  The boy's name was Ran de Lucian, and all the people of Balric admired
and loved him.
  Lucian was possessed of a wisdom lacked by most humans.  When his father
passed on, Lucian's first edict was that he wished to see an end to the hatred
between our people and the humans.
  In the first display of compassion that we had ever experienced from the
humans, de Lucian granted us the land we occupied as our own.  Additionally,
he completely emancipated those few of our people who were still in servitude.
Following de Lucian's example, King Shandar of Tansar and King Osen of
Ba-ul Naran did the same.  We were a people given back our dignity, and as
such, even we bitter elves developed a great admiration for Makilor's King.
  An interesting side note, it is rumored that King Ran de Lucian was once
the best of friends with a mage by the name of Terra.  With Lucian's
coronation, Terra became incredibly bitter.  Jealous of the love extended to
Lucian, Terra swore that he would never follow a "dreamer and a fool".  It
was roughly 20 years ago that Terra began to experiment with the black arts
of reanimation.  Some say, that it was these experiments which gave the
dreaded Sanaluth cause to approach him.

~
E
world today 3~
  Today, Balric finds itself in a time of choosing.  Never before have the
forces of good had a champion as great as de Lucian, but the dreaded Sanaluth
has never been bolder.  We stand upon a crossroads where we must choose our
destiny.
  Unfortunately, many are ignorant of this truth, and continue to war amongst
themselves.  Ba-ul Naran and Bakora's kingdom of Darcan battle constantly
over the trade routes of the high seas, and the stubborn Osen has even
occasionally threatened Makilor itself.  Fortunately, Novdom, Makilor and
Tansar are allies, and work together as best they can to maintain the peace
of the empire.  We elves still prefer to stay away from the other races, as
old prejudices do die hard.  The Gralner occupy the Black Sands Desert, and
the dwarves mine precious metals in the snow-covered mountains around Tansar.
The halflings have all but been assimilated into the citizenry of Novdom, 
and the giant's numbers seem to constantly fade.
  Sanaluth is said to marshal his forces around the edges of Balric, and
rumors of nightmarish armies of the undead float back to us from the west where
Terra fled.  To the south, travellers speak of some foul temple where clerics
of Nixil stand beside monstrous creatures.  Most disturbing though, is the
word of Sanaluth himself residing in the ruins of Rac Samdar...
  Is it time to set aside our petty differences and unite against the common
threat?

book tribes moon~
  Flipping open the crimson and black tome entitled "The Tribes of the Moon"
elicits a slight chill.  None the less, you read the following passage,

  It is said that among the Hordes, there was a small group of warriors that
knew honor despite their own malevolence.  Contrary as it may sound, they
were aware of their evil, and despised themselves for it.  Evil was a part of
their very nature, and for them, there was no escaping it.
  Known as the Tribes of the Moon, this sect of the Hordes were comprised
primarily of the so called "Creatures of the Night".  They did not hate the
denizens of the day, so much as feel that for themselves to be free, the
diurnal creatures must fall.  Night eternal was their vision, and they would
do what was necessary to create it, and bring their vision of dark beauty to
the world.
  Unfortunately, one of the earlier battles scattered this group, and it would
not be until an enigmatic swordsman appeared that the Tribes of the Moon would
reappear.  No one knows this warrior's true name, he referred to himself
simply as "Infidel", a name which reflected his sense that the gods themselves
had damned him.  In his earlier years, Infidel had been a warrior of good, but
when his elvish love was crudely slaughtered by the assassin Pe Ell, he
renounced the forces of light.
  As his power grew, Infidel began to seek redemption for the sins he had
committed.  He was not concerned with evil, but darkness.  The "Obsidian Keep", 
his gloomy abode was erected in Tansar.  Shandif allowed this out of a
recognition of the warrior's skill.
  Gradually, Infidel sought out other lost souls.  With the aid of his fellow
swordsman and friend Dozois, he reformed the Tribes of the Moon under the
simplified name of "Night-Breed".
  Today, the Night-Breed are a shadowy cabal, who are said to appear only
when the outcasts and misfits of the lands are threatened.  The defenders of
the defenseless and hated, they seek redemption, and eventually their
legendary homeland, the subterranean city known only as "Midian".

guardians book tome~
  Within the world of Entia, there are creatures that exist outside of the
struggles between good and evil.  Known simply as "The Guardians", they are
said to be early, forgotten creations of the gods, who are content simply
to guard their fabled treasures.  There are three remaining whom we know of
today, they are Valg the Dreaded Serpent of Darklin Reach, the Demon L'Cath
of Kershalt Territory, and the Fabled Dracolich of the Blacksands Desert.
  Valg guards the legendary blade Shannara.  It is said that his poison can
kill a man before he falls to the ground, and that his tail could smash apart
an entire siege tower.  Additionally, Valg's enormous girth allows him to
prevent anything from being retrieved within his lair.
  The Demon L'Cath's origins are unknown.  She materialized out of the molten
lava of Kershalt's depths, jealously guarding the legendary demonic shield.
Her arcane abilities are fearsome indeed, and her claws can rip most any man
apart in seconds.
  The Dracolich of the Blacksands Desert possesses the sacred tooth of the
first dragon.  There are those who even insist that he is the re-animated
remains of that dragon, a creation of Terra's that rebelled against its
master.  Whatever the Dracolich's origins, it feasts upon the corpses of
foolish adventurers that think to vanquish it without magic at hand.

book diary~

You thumb through the dog-eared pages and become increasingly irritated.
Most of the entries have been written in a tongue which you don't recognize.
It isn't until you get to the more recent entries that the writing changes
to common and you are able to decipher the small, spidery characters.  The
most recent entry reads as follows:
 
  That fool Maahk believes we would actually concern ourselves about his petty
desires for the throne of Mreec.  We have cultivated his delusions by
continuing to send supplies of weapons.  However, we ignore his requests for
food completely.  Fed, his army of riff-raff might become placated and drift
back to Khate's flock.  Hungry though, they are as malleable as clay.
 
The writing continues into the next entry:
 
  Maahk will act soon, I feel, and the discord which my blessed lord wants
shall come to pass.  With Khate occupied, there will be nothing to stop my
brethren within the Mok from infiltrating and seizing the city of Mreec.
An amusing side note, my pathetic worm of a husband has begun to suspect my
true allegiances, I think.  It is of no consequence, and I find the distrust
this breeds in his blessed order amusing.  Still, he may well crawl to Khate.
If that happens, perhaps I shall be obliged to take up business with the
Narani poisoner...

note~

In sloppy, drunken hand-writing, the note reads:
 
Ye've infiltrated the palace, the first part of me plan be done.
 
Khate sleeps each night at twelth-mark, and the changing of the guards occurs
some half-hour later.  At that time, he has but one guard at his door.  Take
that guard out quickly and quietly, and force your way into Khate's chambers.
 
Make the bastard die quickly, but make it bloody.  I intend to put his
traitorous, human-loving head up on a pike when we ride and take Tansar.
 
BURN THIS WHEN YOU'VE READ IT.
